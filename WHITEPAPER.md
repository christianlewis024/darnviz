## Features

The music visualizer comprises four core feature areas: Audio Capture, Visualization, User Interface, and Performance Optimization. Below, each is described in detail.

### Audio Capture

#### Browser Extension:
- A lightweight extension will be developed for Chrome and Firefox to capture audio from the user's PC.
- In Chrome, the extension will leverage the chrome.tabCapture API to capture audio from a specific tab (e.g., a YouTube or Spotify tab).
- For broader system audio capture (e.g., desktop applications or multiple sources), the extension will request elevated permissions, such as audio or media access, depending on browser support.

#### Permissions Popup:
- Upon installation or first use, the extension will display a popup requesting user permission to access audio.
- This ensures compliance with security standards and provides transparency, allowing users to grant or deny access.
- Permissions will be granular where possible (e.g., tab-specific vs. system-wide), giving users control over what audio is captured.

#### Audio Streaming:
- Captured audio will be streamed in real-time from the extension to the web app using a secure communication channel (e.g., WebSockets or Message Passing API).
- The audio stream will be compatible with the Web Audio API for processing and analysis.

### Visualization

#### Visualization Types:
- **2D Visualizations**: Include waveforms, pulsing circles, retro-style equalizer bars, and abstract shapes, rendered using p5.js or the Canvas API.
- **3D Visualizations**: Feature rotating geometries (e.g., cubes, spheres), particle systems, and fluid-like simulations, powered by Three.js.

#### Real-Time Reactivity:
- Visualizations will respond to audio data, including:
  - **Frequency**: Bass (lows), mids, and treble (highs) will influence distinct visual elements (e.g., bass pulses shapes, treble scatters particles).
  - **Amplitude**: Louder audio increases intensity (e.g., larger shapes, brighter colors).
  - **Tempo**: Beat detection (via Web Audio API) may subtly adjust animation speed or transitions.

#### Morphing Effects:
- Beyond audio reactivity, visualizations will evolve over time with smooth transitions (e.g., shapes morphing, colors shifting), ensuring a captivating experience even during quieter audio moments.

### User Interface

#### Minimalistic Design:
- The UI will fade out after 3-5 seconds of inactivity, leaving the visualization unobstructed, and reappear on mouse movement or key press (e.g., spacebar).
- Controls will be compact, positioned along the edges or in a collapsible panel.

#### Customization Controls:
- **Themes**: Predefined options (e.g., Dark, Neon, Pastel) with customizable color palettes.
- **Intricacy Levels**: Simple (low detail, lightweight), Medium (balanced), and High-Detail (complex, resource-intensive).
- **Full-Screen Toggle**: A button to enter/exit full-screen mode.
- **"Find the Vibe" Button**: Randomizes settings or suggests visualizations based on audio mood (e.g., energetic, calm), using basic audio analysis.

#### Local Storage:
- User preferences (e.g., theme, intricacy) will be saved in the browser's local storage, persisting across sessions without requiring a login.

### Performance Optimization

#### Hardware Acceleration:
- Visualizations will use WebGL (via Three.js or raw WebGL) for GPU-accelerated rendering, reducing CPU load.

#### Dynamic Quality Adjustment:
- The app will monitor frame rates using stats.js and adjust rendering quality (e.g., reducing particle counts, lowering resolution) on lower-end devices.

#### Intricacy Scaling:
- Simple mode uses minimal resources (e.g., basic 2D shapes), while High-Detail mode leverages full GPU capabilities for intricate 3D effects.

#### Audio Processing Efficiency:
- Audio analysis will be optimized to process only necessary data (e.g., FFT bins for frequency), minimizing computational overhead.

## Tech Stack

The following technologies will power the music visualizer, chosen for their compatibility, performance, and developer familiarity.

### Browser Extension
